Subproject description:
Site description: 
A. Southeastern Kruger National Park, South Africa; savanna; nutrient-rich basaltic soils (Nhlowa Southern Basalt Supersite); 610 mm average annual rainfall
B. eSwatini: Lubombo Conservancy (Hlane Royal National Park, Mlawlula Nature Reserve, and Mbuluzi Game Reserve)

Sampling design: Between 2013 and 2018, sampling was conducted on four 30.25 ha grids at least 1 km from each other in the Nhlowa Southern Basalt Supersite in Kruger National Park and on six grids in the Lubombo Conservancy in eSwatini (two in Hlane, two in Mlawlula Nature Reserve, and two in Mbuluzi Game Reserve). Within each grid, there are nine 50 m x 50 m plots placed 250 m apart in three rows and three columns. 

After 2018, two grids in the Lubombo conservancy and five grids in Kruger are sampled. These grids each have five plots within them. 
In Kruger, we have implemented an experimental array of fence treetments. Three of the grids have treatments (G1, G2, G4) and two of the grids are controls (G3, G5) with no treatments. Each treatment grid has 5 plots within it: one plot is a full exclosure fence, two plots are partial exclosure fences, one plot is a “fence effect” and one plot is a control. The full exclosure fully exlcludes all land based locomotive animals. The partial fences exclude elephants and giraffes. The ‘fence effect’ plot excludes nothing but has poles with perching habitat to mimic the habitat the full and partial exclosures provide for birds of prey and the presence of poles. The sampling grids (30.25 ha) have been placed at least 1 Km apart. Grid locations were selected to represent the heterogeneity in vegetation in vegetation structure present within the sampling region. Each grid consists of 5, 50 m x 50 m plots spaced 250 m apart such that four plots are centered at the corners and one plot in the centre of the grid (Fig. 1A). Also, grids with experimental manipulation contain five plots with four plots centered at each corner and one plot in the center of the grid; here each grid has one plot designated as a full exclosure treatment (fencing prevents all large herbivores), two plots as partial exclosure treatments (fencing prevents mega-herbivores) and one plot as a mimic treatment (only fencing poles constructed to simulate treatments) and the last plot is the control.
Methods: Since 2013, annual surveys of all four grids have been conducted from mid- to late-May through mid- to late-June (except in 2014 and 2015). In all plots, three 50 m transects are laid out using tape measures to create A and B sides of the plot with the third transect denoting the center of the plot. On each side of the plot, researchers identify and measure all woody plants within each of the following distances from the center line: 0-2 m, 2-10 m, and 10-25 m. All individuals are identified to species, and the height (estimated using an observer height of 1.8 m as a scale), number of stems, and diameter (at breast height, measured with a DBH tape) of up to the five largest stems are measured. Percent canopy breakage is estimated by eye, and whether the damage is old or new (if the impacted area is brown/reddish color, damage is noted as recent, while grey/black color is noted as old damage) or the plant is resprouting in response to breakage is determined. For plants over 3 m tall, we also assess any damage by elephants. The percentage of bark below 3 m that has been removed is estimated by eye. Researchers also determine whether the stripping is new or old (a brown/reddish color is noted as recent, while grey/black color is noted as old stripping) and estimate the amount of bark that has regrown over the stripped area by eye. On the exposed part of the tree, evidence of wood borers and fire scarring is noted. Researchers then note whether or not the tree has been toppled, and, if so, whether the tree has resprouted. Cumulatively, the researchers determine if the majority of damage to the tree was caused by elephants. Finally, the status of the tree, alive or dead, is recorded.
