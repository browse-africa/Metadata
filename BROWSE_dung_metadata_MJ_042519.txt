Subproject description:
Site description: 
A. Southeastern Kruger National Park, South Africa; savanna; nutrient-rich basaltic soils (Nhlowa Southern Basalt Supersite); 610 mm average annual rainfall
B. eSwatini: Lubombo Conservancy (Hlane Royal National Park, Mlawlula Nature Reserve, and Mbuluzi Game Reserve)

Sampling design: Before 2019, surveys were conducted on four 30.25 ha grids at least 1 km from each other in the Nhlowa Southern Basalt Supersite in Kruger National Park and on six grids in the Lubombo Conservancy in eSwatini (two in Hlane, two in Mlawlula Nature Reserve, and two in Mbuluzi Game Reserve). Within each grid, there are nine 50 m x 50 m plots placed 250 m apart in three rows and three columns. 

After 2018, two grids in the Lubombo conservancy and five grids in Kruger are surveyed. These grids each have five plots within them. 
In Kruger, we have implemented an experimental array of fence treetments. Three of the grids have treatments (G1, G2, G4) and two of the grids are controls (G3, G5) with no treatments. Each treatment grid has 5 plots within it: one plot is a full exclosure fence, two plots are partial exclosure fences, one plot is a “fence effect” and one plot is a control. The full exclosure fully exlcludes all land based locomotive animals. The partial fences exclude elephants and giraffes. The ‘fence effect’ plot excludes nothing but has poles with perching habitat to mimic the habitat the full and partial exclosures provide for birds of prey and the presence of poles. The sampling grids (30.25 ha) have been placed at least 1 Km apart. Grid locations were selected to represent the heterogeneity in vegetation in vegetation structure present within the sampling region. Each grid consists of 5, 50 m x 50 m plots spaced 250 m apart such that four plots are centered at the corners and one plot in the centre of the grid (Fig. 1A). Also, grids with experimental manipulation contain five plots with four plots centered at each corner and one plot in the center of the grid; here each grid has one plot designated as a full exclosure treatment (fencing prevents all large herbivores), two plots as partial exclosure treatments (fencing prevents mega-herbivores) and one plot as a mimic treatment (only fencing poles constructed to simulate treatments) and the last plot is the control.
Methods: Seasonal surveys are conducted from May through June and November through December. At each plot, five 50 m north to south transects are established at 5, 15, 25, 35, and 45 m. One observer walks the line identifying dung piles within 5 m of the transect with the data recorder. For each dung pile, the perpendicular distance from the center of the line to center of dung pile is measured, the pile is identified to species (if unknown, a picture with a scale is taken), and the diameter of the pile at its widest point is measured. For elephant dung, the diameter of each individual dung is measured. Large dung and piles are then broken into small piles and scattered on the plot.
